# Horse-and-Human
# Overview
This project focuses on building a horse-and-human recognition system using deep learning techniques. The system is designed to classify images into two classes: horses and humans. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can distinguish between images containing horses and humans.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images containing horses and humans. It is divided into training and validation sets, with labeled images for supervised learning. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented as necessary to improve model performance and generalization.

# Model Architecture
The horse-and-human recognition model is built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The architecture typically consists of convolutional neural network (CNN) layers followed by fully connected layers. Techniques like dropout and batch normalization may be used to prevent overfitting and improve model robustness.
